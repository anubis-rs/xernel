# xernel
A kernel that tries to support multiple architectures/platforms using a hybrid kernel architecture.
It's using the limine protocol.
Mostly made for learning purposes, no real-world application.

## Building
For building, you simply need a working Rust installation with the nightly toolchain installed and the `mtools` package which we use for the generation of the disk image.
We use xtask as our workflow for building and running the kernel.
Therefore the command `cargo kernel` is used.

See `cargo kernel help` for a list of subcommands and available flags.

You can simply use `cargo kernel build` or `cargo kernel run`, it is going to use x64 as the default target.

    - [ ] Rewrite the virtual memory manager, just make it better
    - [ ] Switch from linked_list_allocator to a slab allocator for heap
- [ ] Implement a virtual file system
- [ ] Implement a driver system
- [ ] Implement a proper syscall interface
- [ ] Implement a proper userspace
- [ ] Implement a proper init system
