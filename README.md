# xernel
A kernel which tries to support multiple architectures/platforms using a hybrid kernel architecture.
It's using the limine protocol.
Mostly made for learning purposes, no real world application.

## Building
At first you need a C compiler for limine (it is already builded but still needs a compiler for deploying and version number).
For building you simply need a working Rust installation with the nightly toolchain installed.
We use xtask as our workflow for building and running the kernel.
Therefore the command `cargo kernel` is used.

See `cargo kernel help` for a list of subcommands and available flags.

You can simply use `cargo kernel build` or `cargo kernel run`, it is going to use x64 as default target.

## TODO
Things which are still to do:
- [ ] Rewrite mem module
    - Rewrite page frame allocator so it uses a buddy allocator
    - Rewrite the virtual memory manager, just make it better
    - Switch from linked_list_allocator to a buddy allocator for heap too
- [ ] Implement a virtual file system
- [ ] Implement a driver system
- [ ] Implement a proper syscall interface
- [ ] Implement a proper userspace
- [ ] Implement a proper init system
